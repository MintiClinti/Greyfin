Greyfin is an app that aims to connect elders in need of assistance to caretakers.

Elders first fill in basic information about their caretaker preferences: gender, age, spoken language. 

Then they are prompted to write more in depth responses about their situation, needs and hobbies.

Finally, Greyfin will use natural language processing to best match caretakers to the elders' preferences.

For the caretaker side, they will also fill out a form with basic information (contact, gender, age, location, etc) and will be added to Greyfin's database.
